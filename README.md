# TypeScript-Command-line-Application

## Description
ThisTypeScript command-line application that builds and uses cars to include additional options for motorbikes and trucks.
in this App the user to either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle (uses cars). After going through the creation or selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle. The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.

- **Motivation:** I wanted to build an interactive Command-Line Application (CLI) that simulates vehicle management, leveraging TypeScript, OOP principles, and user input handling.
- **Purpose:** This project demonstrates how to create a scalable, well-structured CLI using TypeScript, implementing:

1. Class-based inheritance
2. Interfaces
3. User interactions with Inquirer.js
- **Problem Solved:** 
1. Simulates real-world vehicle management (creating, managing, and performing actions).
2. Introduces structured object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
3. Implements error handling, user prompts, and dynamic choices in a CLI.
- **What I Learned:** 
1. How to use TypeScript with OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and interfaces.
2. How to implement an interactive CLI using Inquirer.js.
3. Handling asynchronous user inputs efficiently in a structured TypeScript application.
4. How to enforce type safety and avoid runtime errors with TypeScript.
